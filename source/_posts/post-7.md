# Introduction 

The speed of light has been studied since ancient times.  The first report on its questioning came from the philosopher Empedocles, in the $V$ century B.C. Decades later, Aristotle disagreed with Empedocles, who claimed that light had an infinite speed. It is customary to cite Galileo Galilei and the experiment of the two lanterns separated by a great distance; however, there are no records of the values obtained with this experiment or whether it was actually carried out.

Over the course of history, especially in the last 400 years, the speed of light visible in air and/or in a vacuum has become more and more precise, approaching the reference value of $c = 2.99796 x 10^8 m/s$, which is what is considered today.  The representation $ c $ refers to the Latin term celeritas, which means speed of propagation.

In addition to the discussion about the speed at which light propagates, its nature has also been the subject of study.  Isaac Newton believed that light was made up of particles, while Christian Huygens believed that light was an electromagnetic wave, which could travel without the need for a physical medium to transport it [1].

With this thought that light is an electromagnetic wave and that it is possible to calculate its speed, the necessary motivation to carry out this experiment was created,  since gamma radiation (γ) is also an electromagnetic wave [1], and therefore must move with a speed similar to that of light, i.e. $ c = 2.99796 x 10^8 m/s $.

# Theoretical Foundations
## Radiation

Radiation is the emission of energy by means of waves or particles[2].

Radiation can also be defined as a process of emission (output) and propagation (movement) of energy by means of particles or electromagnetic waves in motion.

Radiation comes from instability within the nucleus. The atomic nucleus is made up of nucleons, which are neutrons (N) and protons (Z). Protons are positively charged, while neutrons have practically the same mass as protons, but no electrical charge. For the nucleus to be stable, when the number Z of protons in the nucleus increases, the number N of neutrons has to increase even more for stability to be maintained [3].

The 1:1 line is the trend line for nuclear stability, shown in red in Figure 1.  The condition N = Z indicates that these elements have equal numbers of protons and neutrons.  As the atomic number Z increases, the points with stable nuclei move further and further away from the green region in Figure 01, reflecting the fact that an increasing relative number of neutrons is needed to compensate for the electrical repulsion of the protons.  And, as nature tends to be in a condition of equilibrium, the tendency of the atomic nucleus is to reach stability, i.e. the nucleus will emit radiation in order to reach the condition of equilibrium or nuclear stability [3].

Thus, all unstable nuclei disintegrate over time until they become stable.  This disintegration of unstable nuclei is capable of releasing radiation in the form of electromagnetic waves or particles. The particles emitted, of nuclear origin, are called alpha (α) and beta (β+ and β-), as shown in Figure 2.

### ALPHA EMISSIONS $\alpha$

When the number of protons and neutrons is high, the nucleus can become unstable due to the electrical repulsion between the protons, which can exceed the attractive nuclear force [6].   In these cases, the nucleus can emit particles made up of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (4He nucleus), which allows 2 protons and 2 neutrons to be discarded, for a total of 4 nucleons and a large amount of energy. The alpha $\alpha$ decay process is illustrated in Figure 3.

<p style="text-align: center;">

  </p>
{% asset_img "3.png" "Figure 3" %}

### BETA EMISSIONS $\beta$

Beta radiation (β) is the term used to describe positively (β+) or negatively (β-) charged electrons of nuclear origin. Their emission is a common process in small or intermediate mass nuclei, which have an excess of protons or neutrons in relation to the corresponding stable structure [6].  The beta decay process is illustrated in Figure 4.


<p style="text-align: center;">
  Figure 4: Representation of the emission of a $\beta$ particle by a nucleus [6]. <br>
</p>
{% asset_img "4.png" "Figure 4" %}

The emission of β+ radiation comes from the transformation of a proton into a neutron. On the other hand, β- emission occurs when a nucleus has an excess of neutrons inside and therefore a lack of protons.  The compensation mechanism occurs through the transformation of a neutron into a proton plus an electron, which is emitted in the decay process [6].

Figure 5 shows that, in order to reach equilibrium, nuclides decay towards the stability line, reducing the number of protons by β+ decay (nuclides to the left of the stability line) and by β- decay (nuclides to the right of the stability line), to reduce the excess of neutrons.

### Gamma Ray $\gamma$

Gamma rays (γ) are a type of electromagnetic radiation produced in nuclear decay processes. The γ radiation comes from the atomic nucleus which is left with excess energy after emitting α or β particles. The excess energy, referring to an excited state, is released in the form of γ radiation [7]. 

When a nucleus decays by emitting alpha or beta radiation, the residual nucleus usually has its nucleons outside the equilibrium configuration, i.e. they are allocated to excited states.  In order to reach the ground state, they emit excess energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, known as gamma radiation[6].

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
{% asset_img "6.png" "Figure 6" %}

The same happens inside the nucleus, so when you remove a proton or neutron from an inner layer, another proton or neutron comes from another outer layer to fill the gap.  And in the same way, the difference in energy is called a photon or gamma (γ) ray.

Gamma rays (γ) are highly energetic due to their high frequency, greater than 1018 Hz, and consequently low wavelength, of the order of 10-11 m, as can be seen in Figure 7.

The various forms of radiation, characterized by their wavelength, make up the electromagnetic spectrum shown in Figure 7. All waves have the same speed in a vacuum, differing only in their length and frequency, which means they originate from different sources.

There are two types of radiation: ionizing and non-ionizing.  Non-ionizing radiation is an electromagnetic wave with a low frequency and a long wavelength.  Ionizing radiation is radiation that transfers enough energy to expel electrons from the orbital layer, resulting in the creation of ions. This radioactivity takes into account the particles or electromagnetic waves emitted by the atomic nucleus during the process of internal restructuring.

{% asset_img "7.png" "Figure 7" %}

Although the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, its speed in a material medium varies with the wavelength.

Particle emission processes are relatively slow with a half-life (τ1/2) of hundreds of days, but the energized states of the nuclei from this decay have, on average, shorter τ1/2, which can be of the order of nanoseconds (ns). 

The energy of gamma radiation is well defined and depends only on the initial and final energy values of the orbitals involved in the transition, i.e,

\begin{equation}
E_y = E_i - E_f = h.v 
\end{equation}

where $ E $ is the energy, $ h $ is Planck's constant ( $ 6.6252 x 10^-34 J.s $ ) and $ v $ is the frequency of the radiation[6].

γ-radiation can be classified in energy terms as low and medium energy (a few KeV to 30 MeV) and high and very high energy (31 MeV to 100 GeV).

 
##  INTERACTION OF GAMA RAYS $\gamma$ WITH MATTER

Gamma rays (γ) are indirectly ionizing particles that, when they pass through matter, can deposit energy in it, in a process that consists of two steps: transferring energy to a charged particle (electron or positron) and then depositing the energy transferred to the charged particle in the medium[6].

The photon or gamma ray (γ) can interact with the entire atom, with the atomic nucleus or with an orbital electron.  Considering an interaction between the photon and the atom as a whole, when a photon penetrates matter, as shown in Figure 8, three effects can occur: the first would be its transmission without any interaction occurring; the second would be the occurrence of total absorption, with total transfer of its energy to light charged particles, such as electrons or positrons, and finally scattering from its original direction.

<p style="text-align: center;">
 Figure 8: Possible interactions between the photon and the atom [9].<br>
</p>
{% asset_img "8.png" "Figure 8" %}

Considering photon scattering, there are two possibilities: the resulting photon has the same energy as the incident photon, or the resulting photon has a lower energy than the incident photon[6].

If they have the same energy, the resulting photon, in addition to being scattered and moving in a different direction to the original, does not release any electrons or positrons in the interaction.  If they have different energies, the difference in energy is transferred as kinetic energy to the moving electron.

## 1.3 PHENOMENA FOR MEASURING RADIATION

The main types of γ-ray interactions with matter are: Photoelectric Absorption, Compton Scattering and Pair Production.  Read about these interactions here [click here](https://scientistsnotes.github.io/2024/07/13/post_2/).

## 1.4 $22Na$ decay
The sodium isotope 22 (22Na) is one of the unstable elements shown in Figure 1 that are trying to reach equilibrium and thus emit radiation. 22Na is an artificial isotope with a τ1/2 of approximately 2.6 years.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
{% asset_img "9.png" "Figure 9" %}

It decays by emitting a positron (β+ decay) into stable Neon (22Ne). A very small proportion of decays lead directly to the ground state of Ne. The rest lead to an excited Ne state, partly by capturing electrons from the inner atomic layer, but mainly by emitting positrons. The excited Ne state passes into the ground state, through which a 1274 keV γ quantum is emitted, due to the photoelectric effect.  Figure 09 shows the decay lines of 22Na and we can see the peaks of these energies in the graph in Figure 10. 

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
{% asset_img "10.png" "Figure 10" %}

The emitted positrons react with the electrons in the surrounding matter and lead to a characteristic annihilation radiation at 511 keV.  This energy peak is also shown in the graph in Figure 13. Because of the conservation of momentum, two γs are produced in the pair annihilation of a positron and an electron, as shown in Figure 11. These photons are emitted in opposite directions.

Table 1 below shows the different types of energies and intensities of γ radiation, as well as the interactions that cause them.

The main aim of this experiment is, by studying these decays, to construct the energy spectrum of 22N and measure the time of flight of these γs.  In order to carry out this experiment, we begin to assemble the equipment and electronics involved, which we'll see in the next post.
