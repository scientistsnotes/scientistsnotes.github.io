In my last post, I talked a bit about the 5 most serious radiological accidents that have occurred over the years [Click here](). And I've separated out some questions that I found interesting and would like to answer: And when an accident happens, how are people contaminated?  We'll talk about that in this post.

We can briefly describe radiation as a physical phenomenon that can be defined as energy in motion, i.e. the propagation of a particle between two points in space, either through a vacuum or through any material medium. [1]

Radiation can also be transmitted by electromagnetic waves, which are waves originating from magnetic or electric fields, and which vary in time and propagate in space.

There are three types of radiation[2]: alpha, beta and gamma (Figure 01), which can be classified according to the risk to humans as:

Alpha : Causes minor damage.  They are stopped by the layer of dead skin cells, causing burns at most.

Beta: Causes medium damage.  They can penetrate up to 2 cm into our skin.

Gamma: Causes serious damage.  It can pass completely through our body and even cause changes to the structure of DNA.

When radioactive material is released into the atmosphere, as we have seen in most accidents, it comes into contact with human beings and can contaminate them or just expose them.  There is a big difference between contamination and exposure (Figure 02).

For example, alpha radiation stops at the skin layer, hair or clothing, causing only external contamination, thus causing burns. Alpha radiation is dangerous when ingested or inhaled, i.e. when internal contamination occurs.  In this case, the radioactive material can accumulate in different organs, leading to death.  This is what happened in the Cesium-137 accident in Goiania.

As an example of exposure, we can cite X-ray machines, which are widely used in the medical field. A person who has had an X-ray is exposed to radiation, but is not contaminated. And this exposure to radiation occurred at a dose too small to be harmful to their health.

But what is a very small dose? To calculate the effects of radiation on our bodies, we use a measure called a Sievert.  The average dose of radiation that a person receives each year here in Brazil is 2.8 mSv (thousandths of a Sievert). Normally, 48% of the total radiation we receive comes from medical procedures[3]; so the rest of the radiation we receive comes naturally. This “natural radiation” will be the subject of future posts!

 According to table 01, the dose limit for an individual is 1 mSv/year[4], which means that doses above this level can cause various types of damage such as cell death, blood problems, infertility, DNA problems and many others.  Table 02 shows the radiation doses related to the damage caused to humans.

<p style="text-align: center;">

[a] The term annual dose should be taken to mean the dose in the period from January to December of each year. [b] Arithmetic mean over 5 consecutive years, provided it does not exceed 50 mSv in any year.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Table 02: Dose limits for workers and the public [4]</p>
{% asset_img "4.webp" "Table 02" %}

When calculating the doses in Table 02, the following factors were taken into account: exposure time, distance from the radioactive source and containment barriers, which can be considered as ways of preventing radiological damage.  The formula used in this calculation is given by:

$$Dose = \Gamma\frac{At}{d^2}$$

Where: $\Gamma $ is the specific radiation constant, $ A $ is the activity of the radioactive source, $ t $ is the time the patient was exposed and $ d $ is the distance from the radioactive source.

{% asset_img "5.webp" "Table 02" %}

By analyzing the formula above, you can see that the shorter the exposure time, the greater the distance and the more containment barriers, the more protected the individual will be. So these should be the important factors when being in the presence of a radioactive source. In addition, as highlighted above, internal contamination is much more dangerous, which is why protecting the nose and mouth is essential.
